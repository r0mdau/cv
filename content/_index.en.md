## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/586e9d363077c0a9572652c9f5a4fcf3" >}}

Passionate about online information technologies, distributed sustems and the human organizations that operate them.

With my 9 years of professional experience, I have acquired expertise in web technologies, comfortable in multiple fields: architecture, software engineering, reliability engineering, distributed systems, security, performance, system and network administration. My ability to take a step back allowed me to develop strong skills in managing complex projects, managing software development teams, managing budgets and managing products.

My hobbies: former road and track cycling coach and enjoys swimming, running and mountain hiking.
